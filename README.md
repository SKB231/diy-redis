### This is my repo to track building the basic functionality of Redis in C++ with the help of the guided challenges from codecrafters.io

This project runs on C++ 11. I have also included a tester file in src/client.cpp to test the server. Simply compile both files to run each of them. Note that the client will only run if the server is active and in the same port specified in the file.

In this challenge, you'll build a toy Redis clone that's capable of handling
basic commands like `PING`, `SET` and `GET`. Along the way we'll learn about
event loops, the Redis protocol and more.

**Note**: If you're viewing this repo on GitHub, head over to
